It's hard to navigate the landscape of funding in response to the COVID-19 crisis. This app is a tool that attempts to streamline that process. Users are asked a few simple questions to direct them to either funding or donation opporunities to best serve their needs.

Built by Joanna Tomassoni. Designed by Lauren Ambrosio of [Creative Roam](https://creativeroam.com/). Envisioned by Savas Cal as part of the All Pro Bono project.
